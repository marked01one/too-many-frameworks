# Too Many Frameworks
### One App... 70+ Tech Stacks???
This repository is an attempt for me to build 10 REST APIs and 7 frontend user interfaces. 

The catch? **Each backend/frontend uses a different framework & programming language**

That means that if you mix and match, up to **70 different tech stacks** can be used to run this app. This number can even increase depending on how the project will expand in the future.

## The App
The app itself is a simple to-do list application that have certain basic functionalities, such as:
* Ability to **create, get, update, and delete** the to-do's
* Ability to **categorize** to-do's into different groups.
* Ability to **select & serve** to-do's based on current user login.
* Users will have **basic authentication features** like regex-filtered passwords and hashing.
