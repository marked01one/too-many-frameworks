# Too Many Frameworks
### One App... 70+ Tech Stacks???
This repository is an attempt for me to build 10 REST APIs and 7 frontend user interfaces. 

The catch? **Each backend/frontend uses a different framework & programming language**

That means that if you mix and match, up to **70 different tech stacks** can be used to run this app. This number can even increase depending on how the project will expand in the future.

## The App
The projects will have multiple apps to choose from at the end. Currently, the first app in the making is a to-do list app.

### 1. To-do List for All
The app itself is a simple to-do list application that have certain basic functionalities, such as:
* Ability to **create, get, update, and delete** the to-do's
* Ability to **categorize** to-do's into different groups.
* Ability to **select & serve** to-do's based on current user login.
* Users will have **basic authentication features** like regex-filtered passwords and hashing.

## Frameworks
The app will have a total of 10 server-side frameworks & 7 client-side frameworks, which can be interchangeable using a custom-made dashboard by the end of this project.
